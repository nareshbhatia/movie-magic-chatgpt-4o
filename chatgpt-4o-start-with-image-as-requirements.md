# ChatGPT 4o - Start with image as requirements

In the interest of brevity, I have deleted intermediate responses from ChatGPT
while I was trying to refine the requirements.

## Prompt 1

You are a UI designer with 30 years of experience. Give me a detailed
description of what's in this image.

![Image as requirements](assets/chatgpt-4o-image-as-requirements.png)

## Prompt 2

There is also a Moon icon in the "Header and Navigation" section. What is that
for? Can you please include it in your list?

Also please include the badge with the number 250 in the "Filter & Sort"
section. This badge shows the number of movies displayed in the movie list.

## Prompt 3

Rename "Moon Icon" to "Mode Toggle" and change its description to "toggle for
switching between light and dark modes, enhancing user customization".

Add App Logo before App Name.

## Prompt 4

Switch the positions of "Profile Icon" and "Mode Toggle" because "Mode Toggle"
appears first.

Replace "Badge with Number 250" with "Badge with a number" and change the
description to "Located at the far right of this section, showing the total
number of movies currently displayed in the list".

In this sentence, add "ranking" as the first item in the list: "Each movie entry
includes a thumbnail poster, title, genres, rating, release year, and runtime".

## Prompt 5

Change the bullet for filter and sort button to this: "Filter & Sort Button:
located at the far left, allows the user to organize and refine the movie list
based on various criteria such as genre, rating, release year, etc".

## Prompt 6

Add the following height specifications for each section:

1. Header and Navigation section: 56px
2. Filter and Sort section: 56px
3. Movie list header (containing titles for each column): 39px
4. Movie list entry (each entry describing one movie): 112px with a 8px padding
   all around, no vertical gap between entries.

## Prompt 7 - Ask to generate code

As a Web developer with 30 years of experience, write the code for the Movie
Magic web application as outlined by your description above. Make sure that all
the requirements as described above are accurately fulfilled.

Use the following tech stack with the latest versions you know:

1. TypeScript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
2. Next.js (https://nextjs.org/) - make sure to use the App Router, not the Page
   Router
3. Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com/)
4. Radix UI (https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives)

To generate the code, use the following steps:

1. First analyze the requirements from your previous answer.
2. Ask questions if something is not clear or contradictory.
3. Generate the code.

## ChatGPT response - Final code + clarifying questions

To generate the code for the Movie Magic web application using the specified
tech stack, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Analyze the Requirements**:

   - Header with app logo, name, navigation options, mode toggle, and profile
     icon.
   - Filter & Sort section with a button and a badge showing the number of
     movies displayed.
   - Movie list with columns for ranking, title, rating, year, and runtime.
   - Each movie entry includes a ranking, thumbnail poster, title, genres,
     rating, release year, and runtime.
   - Specific height requirements for each section.

2. **Questions to Clarify**:

   - Are the thumbnail images available via a URL, or should we use placeholder
     images?
   - Should the mode toggle functionality be implemented, or is a placeholder
     sufficient?

3. **Generate the Code**:

We'll start by setting up a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind
CSS. Then, we'll create the necessary components and pages.

### Step 1: Setup Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

First, create a new Next.js project and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest movie-magic --typescript
cd movie-magic
```

Install Tailwind CSS and Radix UI:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
npx tailwindcss init -p
npm install @radix-ui/react-switch
```

Configure Tailwind CSS in `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Create `globals.css` in the `styles` directory and include Tailwind's base,
components, and utilities:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Step 2: Create Components

Create the necessary components for the app: `Header`, `FilterSort`, and
`MovieList`.

#### `components/Header.tsx`

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Switch } from '@radix-ui/react-switch';

const Header: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <header className="flex items-center justify-between h-14 bg-gray-900 text-white px-4">
      <div className="flex items-center space-x-4">
        <img src="/logo.png" alt="App Logo" className="h-8" />
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Movie Magic</h1>
        <nav className="flex space-x-4">
          <a href="#" className="hover:underline">
            Movies
          </a>
          <a href="#" className="hover:underline">
            Watchlist
          </a>
        </nav>
      </div>
      <div className="flex items-center space-x-4">
        <Switch className="bg-gray-700 rounded-full p-1">Mode</Switch>
        <img
          src="/profile.png"
          alt="Profile"
          className="h-8 w-8 rounded-full"
        />
      </div>
    </header>
  );
};

export default Header;
```

#### `components/FilterSort.tsx`

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const FilterSort: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between h-14 bg-gray-800 text-white px-4">
      <button className="bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
        Filter & Sort
      </button>
      <div className="bg-gray-700 text-white rounded-full px-3 py-1">250</div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default FilterSort;
```

#### `components/MovieList.tsx`

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const movies = [
  {
    rank: 1,
    title: 'The Shawshank Redemption',
    genres: 'Drama',
    rating: 'R',
    year: 1994,
    runtime: '2:22',
    poster: '/shawshank.jpg',
  },
  // Add the rest of the movies here
];

const MovieList: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="text-white">
      <div className="grid grid-cols-6 h-10 bg-gray-700 items-center px-4">
        <span>#</span>
        <span>Title</span>
        <span>Rating</span>
        <span>Year</span>
        <span>Runtime</span>
        <span>Poster</span>
      </div>
      {movies.map((movie, index) => (
        <div
          key={index}
          className="grid grid-cols-6 h-28 bg-gray-800 items-center px-4 border-b border-gray-700"
        >
          <span>{movie.rank}</span>
          <div>
            <h3 className="font-bold">{movie.title}</h3>
            <p className="text-sm">{movie.genres}</p>
          </div>
          <span>{movie.rating}</span>
          <span>{movie.year}</span>
          <span>{movie.runtime}</span>
          <img src={movie.poster} alt={movie.title} className="h-24 w-16" />
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MovieList;
```

### Step 3: Create the Main Page

#### `app/page.tsx`

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import Header from '../components/Header';
import FilterSort from '../components/FilterSort';
import MovieList from '../components/MovieList';

const HomePage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-gray-900 min-h-screen">
      <Header />
      <FilterSort />
      <MovieList />
    </div>
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Summary

The code above sets up a Next.js application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and
Radix UI, fulfilling the requirements outlined for the Movie Magic web
application. It includes a header with navigation, mode toggle, and profile
icon, a filter and sort section with a button and a badge showing the total
number of movies, and a movie list with specified height requirements. Each
movie entry includes the necessary details and is styled according to the given
specifications.

## Prompt 8 - Answers to clarifying questions

Here are the answers to your questions:

1. Are the thumbnail images available via a URL, or should we use placeholder
   images? **Answer**: URLs are available, don't use placeholders.

2. Should the mode toggle functionality be implemented, or is a placeholder
   sufficient? **Answer**: A placeholder is sufficient

Please adjust the code based on these answers.

## ChatGPT response - adjustments to final code

Based on the provided answers, I will adjust the code to use URLs for the
thumbnail images and ensure the mode toggle is a placeholder.
