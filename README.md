# Movie Magic ChatGPT 4o

A movie streaming app generated by [ChatGPT 4o](https://chatgpt.com) (a general
purpose generative UI tool).

I started with the raw implementation generated by ChatGPT. Then, I refined and
enhanced the code through a series of manual adjustments to align it with my
coding standards. Each modification has been thoroughly documented in the commit
history below.

## Tech Stack

1. Framework: React 18 + Next.js
2. Styling: Tailwind CSS & Radix UI
3. Linting: Code Shaper ESLint configuration

## Prompt used for app generation

Write a movie streaming application called "Movie Magic".

Use the following tech stack:

1. TypeScript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
2. Next.js (https://nextjs.org/)
3. Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com/)
4. Radix UI (https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives)

The application should support light and dark mode, with dark mode as the
default.

The theme of the application should be red, This means that when you need to use
accent colors for buttons etc., use red.

The application should consists of the following components from top to bottom.

1. Application header: 56 pixels tall, divided into left and right sections.
   Left section consists of following components from left to right: Logo (a
   film icon), application name ("Movie Magic"), navigation menu with 2 links
   ("Movies" & "Watchlist"). The right section consists of 2 components that are
   right justified, and they are (from left to right): light/dark mode toggle,
   signed in user's avatar.

2. Movie filters: Three movie filters all in one row: (a) Search input, (b)
   "Categories" dropdown (multi-select), (c) "Certification" dropdown with
   checkboxes for G, PG, PG-13, R, NR (multi-select)

3. Movie List: one movie per row. Each row contains the movie image, movie name
   and a plus icon to add the movie to the watchlist. The height of the row
   should be 64 pixels

> Note: By default, ChatGPT used the Page Router. I gave it the following prompt
> to switch to the App Router.

In your implementation, use the App Router instead of the Page Router.

## Commits

### commit-1

Initial commit with my starter app.

### commit-2

Added code suggested by ChatGPT. While the code was nice and modular, there were
issues with it:

1. ChatGPT does not know that components in Next.js are defaulted to React
   Server Components. I had to add `'use client'` on all components because they
   had some kind of interactivity and/or used hooks.
2. ChatGPT added the `<ThemeProvider>` from `next-themes` directly into
   `app/layout.tsx`. This is not allowed because RootLayout is a server
   component. Had to extract `<ThemeProvider>` into a client component called
   `<AppProvider>`.
3. `@radix-ui/react-avatar` import syntax was not correct.
4. The app was reporting hydration errors on startup, e.g. "Error: Text content
   does not match server-rendered HTML".

### commit-3

Added real movie data. After doing this, the hydration errors went away. They
were probably due to the fake image URLs in the movie data.

As you can see the overall result is pretty good.
