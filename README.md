# Movie Magic ChatGPT 4o

A movie streaming app generated by [ChatGPT 4o](https://chatgpt.com) (a general
purpose generative UI tool).

I tried two approaches:

1. Prompts starting with textual requirements
2. Prompts starting with image requirements

For each approach, I implemented that application with the raw implementation
suggested by ChatGPT. Then, I refined the implementation through a series of
manual steps to make the screen look better. Each modification has been
thoroughly documented in the commit history below.

### commit-1

Initial commit with my starter app.

### commit-2

Added code suggested by ChatGPT. While the code was nice and modular, there were
issues with it:

1. ChatGPT does not know that components in Next.js are defaulted to React
   Server Components. I had to add `'use client'` on all components because they
   had some kind of interactivity and/or used hooks.
2. ChatGPT added the `<ThemeProvider>` from `next-themes` directly into
   `app/layout.tsx`. This is not allowed because RootLayout is a server
   component. Had to extract `<ThemeProvider>` into a client component called
   `<AppProvider>`.
3. `@radix-ui/react-avatar` import syntax was not correct.
4. The app was reporting hydration errors on startup, e.g. "Error: Text content
   does not match server-rendered HTML".

### commit-3

Added real movie data. After doing this, the hydration errors went away. They
were probably due to the fake image URLs in the movie data.

As you can see the overall result is pretty good.
